                        <p>Dr. Syed Imtiyaz Hasan is an expert in strategic problem-solving and decision-making, and he’s spent his career advising business leaders – and future leaders – on how to make smart, tough calls in challenging economic climates.</p>

                        <p>With the rising demand to support remote and flexible work,  IT leaders are keenly aware of the need to maintain business continuity for both customers and employees by providing a seamless experience across multiple locations and devices.</p>

                        <p>An enduring demand for remote and flexible work. With 40% of working arrangements, there is a continued need for investment. “What we see is managed services and the ability to manage IT systems remotely become top priorities. And then what we see next are a lot of connectivity types of solutions.”</p>

                        <p>“After having seen the possibility of working from home and how many people are doing that pretty successfully, I know it's possible not to have all that office space. If you have all this empty office space, you can get rid of it somehow and save the money.”</p>

                        <p>While this might not be the best choice for all organizations, the fundamental thinking behind it is applicable to all: with your purpose and mission at the center of decisions, focus on the value you truly deliver and be willing to cut back in other areas.</p>
